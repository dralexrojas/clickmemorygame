# Mad Men Memory Game

## Overview

This is a memory game with React.

### Game Play

1. The game will start when the page loads.  The score is set to 0.

2. The application renders 12 images to the screen.

3. Every time an image is clicked, the images shuffle themselves in a random order.

4. The application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score increases when clicking on an image for the first time. The user's score will reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once before clicking on all 12 images once.

5. The user's score is reset after an incorrect guess and the game will restart.
